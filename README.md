# Shell
This is a small personal unix-shell implementation project.

It's based on well known <b>bash</b> shell.

## Install

Make sure to check all the dependecies (listed below). So far there is user-friendly installation module. (Python script is in progress..)

To <b>install</b> and run use the following command:

<code>make run</code>

## Dependencies

The project is aimed to be as <i>extra</i> dependecies free as possible. Most of commonly used linux distributions (btw i use arch) should already be equiped with these dependecies.
